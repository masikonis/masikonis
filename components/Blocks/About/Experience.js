				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">{"Since building my first website in 2010, I've had a passion for web development that has evolved to include "}<strong>digital marketing</strong>{" and, most recently, "}<strong>artificial intelligence</strong>{". As a full-stack web developer, I help companies navigate the interplay of these three domains."}</p>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">I've worked full-time remotely for over 14 years with clients from both America and Europe. No matter the time difference, I pride myself on getting the work done on time and mesh seamlessly with any team that values effective communication.</p>
				<p className="mb-8 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">My roles as a lead developer and growth engineer have honed my ability to think on my feet and solve problems under pressure. I love working directly with founders and small teams, contributing to product development, growth strategies, and AI-driven solutions.</p>

				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">Too Pixel was a web design agency in Geneva, Switzerland, offering tailor-made solutions to clients. I was one of the first people they hired. Not long after, I became the lead developer, overseeing projects for well-known names like CERN, Notz Stucki, EPFL, Newby of London, and others.</p>
				<p className="mb-6 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">My 7 years working full-time remotely for Too Pixel helped me master my <strong>core skill of web development</strong>. The traditional agency atmosphere also helped me learn how to work effectively as part of a team with high-stakes projects on the line.</p>

				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">My primary skill was web development, but working closely with expert marketers taught me a lot about digital marketing quickly. I was then asked to be part of the Growth Team, which focused on expanding Eric's personal brand and new projects. We followed a 'lean startup' approach, which meant I had to learn new skills fast and find solutions to problems working with limited resources.</p>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">I stayed at the forefront of technological innovation, spearheading the integration of <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> into our work. At Single Grain, I initiated and drove the AI Workforce project, which aimed to enhance the capabilities of human workers through AI.</p>

In my two years leading the development, the website's visitors grew from 250K to 1.25M monthly, and revenue increased sixfold.
