				<h1 className="font-serif mb-6 text-3xl text-center lg:text-left md:text-4xl xl:text-4xl text-gray-800">About Me</h1>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">Since building my first website back in 2004 I’ve had a burning passion for web development, and more recently, conversion rate optimization. Nothing excites me more than delivering work that generates leads &amp; sales reliably on autopilot, helping to free up my client’s valuable time.</p>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">I help companies ensure their websites, funnels, ads, email marketing, and analytics work seamlessly together. I can build these systems from scratch, optimize what’s already there, or simply give my professional opinion on how to solve any business or web-related problem.</p>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">I’ve worked full-time remotely for over 13 years with clients from both America and Europe. I’m based in Lithuania but no matter the time difference, I pride myself on getting the work done on time and mesh seamlessly with any team that values great communication.</p>
				<p className="mb-8 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">My roles as lead developer, web consultant, and advisor to companies in many different fields has helped me to think on my feet and solve problems fast. That’s why unlike a lot of other developers, I thrive in fast-paced environments with tight deadlines and high-expectations.</p>
				<h2 className="mb-4 font-serif text-gray-800 text-2xl">Work Experience</h2>
				<p className="mb-6 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">Over the years I’ve had the pleasure to work with some truly great companies and clients.</p>
				<h2 className="mb-4 font-serif text-gray-800 text-lg md:text-xl">Too Pixel</h2>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">Too Pixel was a traditional web design agency focused on providing custom-built solutions for their clients. After becoming one of their first hires, I was soon promoted to the lead developer role and managed projects for brands including: CERN, Notz Stucki, EPFL, Newby of London, and much more.</p>
				<p className="mb-6 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">My 7 years working full-time remotely for Too Pixel helped me master my core skill of web development. The traditional agency atmosphere also helped me learn how to work effectively as part of a team with high-stakes projects on the line. I had to pitch ideas, implement feedback, and shift gears quickly when plans had to change.</p>
				<h2 className="mb-4 font-serif text-gray-800 text-lg md:text-xl">Single Grain</h2>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">Since 2009, Single Grain has been one of the world’s leading digital marketing agencies, with clients like Uber, Amazon, Lyft, SalesForce, and AirBnB. I was first hired to manage all the web properties of the company and report directly to the CEO, Eric Siu, known best for his Marketing School podcast with Neil Patel.</p>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">My core expertise at the time was web development, but being surrounded by award-winning marketers, I quickly learned a lot more about digital marketing and conversion rate optimization. I was soon invited to join the internal Growth Team, responsible for scaling Eric’s personal brand and new business ventures. These projects were built in a ‘lean startup’ mentality, requiring me to learn new skills fast, and find solutions to problems working with limited resources.</p>
				<h2 className="mb-4 font-serif text-gray-800 text-lg md:text-xl">Generation Genius</h2>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">Generation Genius is a Los Angeles based startup building an educational streaming service teaching kids about science &amp; math. During the early phase of the company’s growth I was invited to join as their first full-time web developer.</p>
				<p className="mb-6 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">I led a campaign to overhaul all the legacy systems they had in place. I implemented new features to the website, fixed numerous long-standing bugs, and created an easy way to run &amp; analyze split tests. In my 2 years leading the development growth scaled from 250K to 1.25M visitors per month along with a 6X increase in revenue.</p>
				<p className="mb-6 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-base">Generation Genius has been ranked the <strong>#1 Fastest Growing Education Company in America</strong> on the 2022 Inc5000 list based on an exceptional revenue growth rate of 4,891% from 2018 to 2021.</p>
