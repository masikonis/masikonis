				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-lg">I created my first website in 2004 and I’ve continued to create even more complex ones as my education and skill set grew.</p>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-lg">My <strong className="text-sky-700">formal education</strong> consists of a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics and a Master’s degree in Management. That has allowed me to be able to understand problems and requirements from a business point of view and be able to apply a technology solution to them.</p>
				<p className="mb-8 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-lg"><strong className="text-sky-700">Remote work is in my blood.</strong> I am highly organized, have strong discipline, know the benefits and the challenges. I’ve been working remotely for companies in Geneva, Switzerland and Los Angeles, California as a full-time web developer.</p>
				<h2 className="mb-4 font-serif text-gray-800 text-xl md:text-2xl xl:text-3xl">Diverse Background</h2>
				<p className="mb-4 font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-lg">Having worked as a team leader at Too Pixel, a formerly well-known Swiss web design agency, taught me <strong className="text-sky-700">attention to detail</strong> and instilled in me what great design looks like.</p>
				<p className="font-sans text-gray-800 text-base xl:text-lg">Following that, I worked at Single Grain, a leading digital marketing agency, where I grew my full-stack web development skills and added additional <strong className="text-sky-700">skills in digital marketing</strong> that empower me to help any company scale their business effectively.</p>
